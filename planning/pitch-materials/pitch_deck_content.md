## Slide 2: The Problem

### Drug Discovery is Broken

**$2.6 BILLION**
Average cost to bring one drug to market

**90%**
Failure rate in clinical trials

**12-15 YEARS**
Average development timeline

**Root Cause**: Classical computers cannot accurately simulate molecular interactions at quantum scales

> "We're spending billions guessing which drugs might work, when quantum physics could tell us with certainty."

**Q: Why you?**
A: Only team combining quantum physics expertise with drug discovery experience and healthcare domain knowledge

**Q: What about IBM/Google quantum?**
A: They're building picks and shovels; we're the gold miners. We're application layer, hardware agnostic.

**Q: How do you compete with Recursion?**
A: Different approach. They use classical AI on microscopy images. We simulate molecular physics directly. Complementary, not competitive.

**Q: When profitable?**
A: Break-even Q4 2028 at $60M ARR. Cash flow positive 2029.
