# QBitaLabs Stealth Mode Strategy

**CONFIDENTIAL**

*Strategic Approach to Building in Stealth*

---

## Why Stealth Mode?

### Strategic Rationale

1. **Competitive Protection**
   - Quantum computing for healthcare is an emerging field
   - Large tech companies (Google, IBM, Microsoft) are watching
   - Early disclosure could trigger well-funded competitors

2. **Customer Development**
   - Build genuine relationships without hype
   - Focus on product-market fit, not PR
   - Let results speak louder than press releases

3. **Talent Acquisition**
   - Top quantum talent values substance over sizzle
   - Avoid "quantum washing" stigma in industry
   - Build reputation through word-of-mouth

4. **Fundraising Leverage**
   - Create FOMO among investors
   - Control narrative and timing
   - Avoid public scrutiny during early stage

## Stealth Mode Principles

### What We Share

| Audience | What We Share | What We Don't Share |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Investors | Full strategy, team, tech | Customer names (w/o permission) |
| Customers | Product capabilities, roadmap | Investor details, valuation |
| Partners | Integration points, use cases | Full tech architecture |
| Employees | Mission, strategy, roadmap | Cap table details, investor names |
| Public | Nothing | Everything |

### Communication Guidelines

**DO**:
- Use NDAs liberally
- Speak at technical conferences (not press)
- Publish academic papers (without commercial details)
- Build relationships one-on-one

**DON'T**:
- Issue press releases
- Speak to journalists
- Post on LinkedIn/Twitter about the company
- Share investor deck publicly
- Discuss specific customer names

## Stealth Pitch Strategy

### Investor Approach

**Outreach Script**:
> "We're building in stealth at the intersection of quantum computing and healthcare. We're not ready for broad fundraising, but selectively talking to a few investors who have deep expertise in [quantum/healthcare/deep tech]. Would you be open to a confidential conversation?"

**NDA Request**:
- Send NDA before first meeting
- Mutual NDA preferred
- 2-year term standard
- Carve-out for information already known

**Information Progression**:

| Meeting | Information Shared |
|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | High-level problem/solution, team |
| 2 | Technical approach, market size |
| 3 | Full pitch deck, financials |
| 4+ | Data room access, references |

### Customer Approach

**Outreach Script**:
> "We're a stealth startup working on next-generation computational tools for drug discovery. We're looking for design partners to co-develop our platform. Everything we do is under strict NDA, but the results have been significant. Would your R&D team be open to a technical discussion?"

**Pilot Structure**:
- All pilots under NDA
- No logo rights without explicit permission
- Reference calls require approval
- Case studies require joint sign-off

## Managing Stealth Risks

### Risk: Talent Leakage

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Employees talk | Strong culture, NDA enforcement |
| Departures | Exit interviews, remind of obligations |
| Contractors | Limited scope, compartmentalization |

### Risk: Investor Disclosure

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| LPs ask about deals | Standard fund confidentiality |
| Investor shop deal | Limited syndicate, trusted VCs only |
| Due diligence leaks | Watermarked documents |

### Risk: Customer Disclosure

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Customer announces | NDA with PR clause |
| Conference presentations | Joint review required |
| Competitor learns | Compartmentalize information |

### Risk: Competitor Response

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Big tech builds similar | Speed to market, patents |
| Startup pivot to compete | Customer lock-in, relationships |
| Open source alternative | Proprietary models, support |
