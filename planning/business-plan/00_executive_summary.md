### Funding Request

**Series A: $25M**

| Use of Funds | Amount | Percentage |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| R&D / Engineering | $12M | 48% |
| Commercial Expansion | $6M | 24% |
| Cloud Infrastructure | $4M | 16% |

## Problem Statement

### The Drug Discovery Crisis

The pharmaceutical industry faces an existential challenge:

- **$2.6 billion** average cost to bring a new drug to market
- **10-15 years** development timeline
- **90% failure rate** in clinical trials
- **Patent cliffs** threatening $150B in annual revenues by 2030

**Root Cause**: Classical computing cannot accurately simulate molecular interactions at quantum scales. Drug candidates that appear promising in silico fail in clinical trials because the underlying simulations are fundamentally limited.

### Healthcare Inefficiency

- **$4.3 trillion** annual US healthcare spending
- **30% waste** due to ineffective treatments
- **Reactive care model** treats symptoms, not causes
- **One-size-fits-all** treatments ignore genetic variation

### The Precision Medicine Gap

Despite $25B+ invested in genomics, precision medicine adoption remains at <5%:

- **Data silos** prevent integrated analysis
- **Computational barriers** limit multi-modal data fusion
- **No actionable insights** for clinicians
