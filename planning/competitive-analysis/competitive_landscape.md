# QBitaLabs Competitive Landscape Analysis

**CONFIDENTIAL**

*Updated: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

QBitaLabs operates at the convergence of three technology domains: quantum computing, AI/ML, and healthcare. This unique positioning means we face different competitors in different contexts, but no single competitor matches our full-stack approach.

**Key Insight**: The market is nascent enough that our biggest competition is the status quo (classical methods) rather than other quantum-healthcare startups.
